Haar feature-based cascade classifier (first cell):
Modify imgPath to different image paths to test the cascade classifier face detection using different images.

SVM training (second cell):
Change samplePath to the directory containing the training image set. It is not necessary to run this code, as the training model has already been provided. 

SVM prediction (third cell):
Change testPath to the directory containing image set whose labels are to be predicted.
